Pixie,

You should definitely check out the file blue_Telemat-booth.txt, if you haven't already.

There are a few clues that could help you here hidden in local files as well as on the forum.

Have fun!


Oh, yeah... Did I mention that I included all of your CHEAT commands???
(They're in your bag of tricks.)

Best regards,
K.V.
